    <h2>api setup</h2>
    <p>follow the steps as listed <a href="https://github.com/datkat21/FFL-Testing-with-hats?tab=readme-ov-file#running";>here, </a>, but when git clone part, you need to clone renderer server branch', like <span style="background-color:powderblue;">git clone --recursive --branch renderer-server-prototype https://github.com/ariankordi/FFL-Testing
</span> then enter the cloned directory with <span style="background-color:powderblue;"> cd FFL-Testing</span></p>
<p> for installing requirements on opensuse, its <span style="background-color:powderblue;">zlib-devel</span> <span style="background-color:powderblue;">Mesa-libGL-devel</span> <span style="background-color:powderblue;">libglfw-devel </span></p>
<p>build the project using instructions then launch ffl_testing_2 as server with <span style="background-color:powderblue;">./ffl_testing_2 --server</span> then make new terminal tab. in new terminal tab, follow steps from  <a href="https://github.com/datkat21/FFL-Testing-with-hats?tab=readme-ov-file#running-the-renderer-server";>here</a>. do not close another tab or ffl_testing_2, otherwise it wouldn't work. i think go method is better, also python method seems like older and it didn't worked for me. just install the go with package manager then type <span style="background-color:powderblue;">go run .</span> inside server-impl directory</p>
<h2>mii creator setup</h2>
<p> install the bun.<a href="https://bun.sh"> bun website.</a></p>
<p>make new terminal tab again, then clone the <span style="background-color:powderblue;">https://github.com/datkat21/mii-creator</span> to directory you want. do not run commands yet.</p>
<h3>important setup</h3>
<p>you have to edit config.ts file inside src folder. open the config.ts file with text editors.</p>
<img src="config.png"><p>when you open up config.ts file, you'll see api url is set as <span style="background-color:powderblue">https://mii-renderer.nxw.pw/miis/image</span>, and localhost url is commented.</p>
<img src="uncomment.png">
<p>uncomment the localhost one then mark(or just can delete but i haven't tested)<span style="background-color:powderblue">https://mii-renderer.nxw.pw/miis/image</span> one as comment
<p>then following the rest of steps as listed <a href="https://github.com/datkat21/mii-creator?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-development">here.<a/> run <span style="background-color:powderblue;">bun i</span> then run <span style="background-color:powderblue;">bun build-ts</span></p>
<p>add another terminal tab then run <span style="background-color:powderblue;">bun run serve</span> there. now go to <span style="background-color:powderblue;">http://localhost:3000</span> then see if it worked successfully. make sure you have all of 4 terminal tabs opened and running servers</p>
